# Computer-Graphics-Airplane-Game

This project is a collision evasion process implemented in the form of a game. Here the user
is allowed to control the movement of the plane through a collision course. The objective is to
evade the obstacles and travel as far as possible. The planeâ€™s upward movement is controlled by
the left mouse button. Holding and pressing the left mouse button takes the plane higher and
releasing the button results in the plane descending down. As the distance covered increases the
speed of the plane increases. The main obstacles are buildings and clouds. The user must make
sure that no part of the plane touches either the clouds or the buildings
